          Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring,
          skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other
          extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create
          psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as
          the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
          or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.
          Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside.
          <br /><br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br /><br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
